Chaotic-Assembler
=================

An assembler for the DCPU assembly language

To run it, you need Python 3.3 installed. (Python 2 won't work, Python 3.0 - 3.2 may work)

You can doubleclick the file and it will ask you to enter an input file and an output file.
It uses it's own location as home location, relative paths should thus start from it's own location.

You can also pass the input and output file as arguments from the command line, like so:

assembler.py inputfile.dasm outputfile.bin
